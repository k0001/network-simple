-- $tcp-101
--
-- This introduction aims to give you a overly simplified overview of some
-- concepts you need to know about TCP sockets in order to make effective use of
-- this module.
--
-- There are two ends in a single TCP connection: one is the TCP «server» and
-- the other is the TCP «client». Each end is uniquely identified by an IP
-- address and a TCP port pair, and each end knows the IP address and TCP port
-- of the other end. Each end can send and receive data to and from the other
-- end.
--
-- A TCP server, once «bound» to a well-known IP address and TCP port, starts
-- «listening» for incoming connections from TCP clients to such bound IP
-- address and TCP port. When a TCP client attempts to connect to the TCP
-- server, the TCP server must «accept» the incoming connection in order to
-- start exchanging data with the remote end. A single TCP server can
-- sequentially accept many incoming connections, possibly handling each one
-- concurrently.
--
-- A TCP client can «connect» to a well-known IP address and TCP port previously
-- bound by a listening TCP server willing to accept new incoming connections.
-- Once the connection is established, the TCP client can immediately start
-- exchanging data with the TCP server. The TCP client is randomly assigned a
-- TCP port when connecting, and its IP address is selected by the operating
-- system so that it is reachable from the remote end.
--
-- The TCP client a and the TCP server can be running in the same host or in
-- different hosts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- $client-side
--
-- Here's how you could run a TCP client:
--
-- @
-- 'connect' \"www.example.org\" \"80\" $ \(connectionSocket, remoteAddr) -> do
--   putStrLn $ \"Connection established to \" ++ show remoteAddr
--   -- Now you may use connectionSocket as you please within this scope,
--   -- possibly using 'recv' and 'send' to interact with the remote end.
-- @

-- | Connect to a TCP server and use the connection.
--
-- The connection socket is closed when done or in case of exceptions.
--
-- If you prefer to acquire and close the socket yourself, then use
-- 'connectSock' and the 'NS.sClose' function from "Network.Socket" instead.
connect
  :: (MonadIO m, C.MonadCatch m)
  => NS.HostName      -- ^Server hostname.
  -> NS.ServiceName   -- ^Server service port.
  -> ((NS.Socket, NS.SockAddr) -> m r)
                      -- ^Computation taking the communication socket
                      -- and the server address.
  -> m r
connect host port = C.bracket (connectSock host port)
                              (liftIO . NS.sClose . fst)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- $server-side
--
-- Here's how you can run a TCP server that handles in different threads each
-- incoming connection to port @8000@ at IPv4 address @127.0.0.1@:
--
-- @
-- 'serve' ('Host' \"127.0.0.1\") \"8000\" $ \(connectionSocket, remoteAddr) -> do
--   putStrLn $ \"TCP connection established from \" ++ show remoteAddr
--   -- Now you may use connectionSocket as you please within this scope,
--   -- possibly using 'recv' and 'send' to interact with the remote end.
-- @
--
-- If you need more control on the way your server runs, then you can use more
-- advanced functions such as 'listen', 'accept' and 'acceptFork'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Start a TCP server that accepts incoming connections and handles them
-- concurrently in different threads.
--
-- Any acquired network resources are properly closed and discarded when done or
-- in case of exceptions.
--
-- Note: This function performs 'listen' and 'acceptFork', so you don't need to
-- perform those manually.

--
-- Note: 'N.maxListenQueue' is tipically 128, which is too small for high
-- performance servers. So, we use the maximum between 'N.maxListenQueue' and
-- 2048 as the default size of the listening queue. The 'NS.NoDelay' and
-- 'NS.ReuseAddr' options are set on the socket.
